/**
 * Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
 * 
 * Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K
 * points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from
 * the range [1, W], where W is an integer. Each draw is independent and the
 * outcomes have equal probabilities.
 * 
 * Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points. What is the
 * probability that she has N or less points?
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10 Output: 1.00000 Explanation: Alice gets a single
 * card, then stops. Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10 Output: 0.60000 Explanation: Alice gets a single
 * card, then stops. In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6
 * points. 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10 Output: 0.73278 Note:
 * 
 * 0 <= K <= N <= 10000 1 <= W <= 10000 Answers will be accepted as correct if
 * they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer. The judging time limit has been
 * reduced for this question.
